## Design & Philosophy

My goal was to create a portfolio that is lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain. I focused on a few key principles:


## Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS**
* **JavaScript**

## 📁 Folder Structure

The project structure is simple and straightforward:

```
├── 📄 index.html                # The main HTML file
├── 🎨 style.css                 # All styles for the portfolio
├── 📜 script.js                 # All JavaScript functionality
├── 🖼️ public/                    # Folder for assets like images
│   └── project-portfolio.png
├── 📄 Resume.pdf                # resume file
└── 📖 README.md
```
