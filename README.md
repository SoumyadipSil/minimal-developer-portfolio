## Design & Philosophy

My goal was to create a portfolio that is lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain. I focused on a few key principles:

* **Simplicity:** Built with vanilla technologies to be lightweight and have zero dependencies. No frameworks, no build steps.
* **Clean Design:** A minimalist, single-page layout that focuses on content without distractions.
* **User Experience:** Includes a dark/light theme toggle that respects and saves user preference, along with other small UX details for a better browsing experience.

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS**
* **JavaScript**

## 📁 Folder Structure

The project structure is simple and straightforward:

```
